This folder contains knowledge files (text, markdown) that the agent can read to improve its understanding of investing strategies.
The agent does not yet automatically ingest these, but you can instruct it to "Read knowledge_base/wyckoff_method.md" to learn from them.

Supported Formats:
- .md (Markdown)
- .txt (Text)

Future Plans:
- Implement a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system here so the agent can query this folder automatically.
