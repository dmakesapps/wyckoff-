# Instructions for the Agent

The goal is to implement a robust math library.
The current test suite `test_target.py` defines the required behavior.
Your job is to modify `target_script.py` until all tests pass.

If you see an `ImportError` regarding missing functions, implement them.
If you see logic errors, fix them.
Do not remove existing functions unless they are incorrect.
